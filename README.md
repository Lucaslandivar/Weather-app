<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>This Weather app provides users with accurate and up-to-date weather information for their location or any location of their choice. With a sleek and intuitive interface, users can easily access current weather conditions, hourly forecasts, and extended weather forecasts for any location worldwide.</p> 

<h2>Why i make this project?</h2>
<p>I built this Weather app to provide users with accurate and accessible weather information. Existing apps often lacked accuracy or user-friendly features, so I aimed to create a reliable tool that offers real-time updates and intuitive navigation. Additionally, developing this project allowed me to enhance my skills in web development and API integration. Overall, I wanted to offer users a seamless experience for staying informed about weather conditions in their area or any location worldwide.</p>
